# youtube-recommender
Create a simple YouTube channel recommender system.

## Background
Every YouTube channel lists other channels that users may be interested based off the channel they are currently viewing.

## Task
Write a python script that takes in a YouTube channel as an input and displays multiple channels that users may also like.
Channels display similar channels on their home pages, so pulling HTML data would be a good place to start. 
Some specifics to include:
1. You should display the number of subscribers for every channel displayed.
